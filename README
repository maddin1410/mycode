Hello,

here are some code examples to easy manage a CodeIgniter 4 project by using Base Model and Controller. 
The BaseModel in app/models holds Functionality to select/inser/update a single table. Table specifications are set in single Models. Here app/models/UserModel as an example.
The BaseController in app/controllers manages the Template rendering. Needed models, libraries and helpers configured here. 
This is for additinal functions all over the project, like check user rights or split tests.

More detaile are not allowed to show in this public project.
